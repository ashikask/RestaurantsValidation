# RestaurantsValidation
The goal of this assignment is to implement a sample project, where you visualize a restaurant list. You are able to sort the restaurant list based on its current openings state and you can select a sort value to further sort the list. Additionally we would like to see you add an option to filter the restaurant list based on the restaurant's name.
